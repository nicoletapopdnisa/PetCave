# PetCave
Mobile App

I will create an app in Android and React-Native, namely a pet todo-list, that explains each breed of pet that you posess and lets you make them a schedule or add some personal tasks regarding them. It is made for people who want to take care of their buddies and never forget all their needs.
The user will need to authenticate in order to access the application.
It will appear a list of all the animals that you currently posess and when tapping one of them, it will appear the list of what you need to buy for them, what you imposed yourself to do when it comes to the happiness of your pet and many many more.
You can add animals: name, breed, photo, age and at each animal, a list will appear in which you can add anything you want to do for them.
You can also delete, update animals/tasks and you can see a chart of animals and all their needs. You can also attach deadlines to each task and a notification will appear in case your close to it.

You can also act like a "babysitter" from someone's pet. That means you can be assigned the animals you need to take care of, and the tasks you need to acquire for them. It means the application has two roles for the user.

I'll add more features in the future.
